Back to work today after a long weekend. After some time fiddling I got some potentially novel CloudFormation working. It starts a state machine execution when a file is written to an s3 bucket.

It is based on [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-cloudwatch-events-s3.html) AWS tutorial which describes how to achieve the same results but within the console.

It uses a cloud trail, set up to notify and create a record of actions against a resource, to emit an event when a write api call is made to a target bucket.

Then an [EventBridge rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/cw-events.html) can be created to start a step function execution.

Here is the Cloud Formation to setup the buckets and cloud trail

> If you are not using the serverless framework you should replace `${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-` with something else

```yml
Resources:
  TargetBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-Targets
  LogBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-logs
  LogBucketPolicy:
    Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref LogBucket
      PolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal: 
              Service: cloudtrail.amazonaws.com
            Action: s3:GetBucketAcl
            Resource: !GetAtt LogBucket.Arn
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal: 
              Service: cloudtrail.amazonaws.com
            Action: s3:PutObject
            Resource: !Sub "${LogBucket.Arn}/*"
            Condition:
              StringEquals:
                "s3:x-amz-acl": bucket-owner-full-control
  TargetTrail:
    Type: AWS::CloudTrail::Trail
    Properties:
      IsLogging: true
      S3BucketName: !Ref LogBucket
      EventSelectors:
        - DataResources:
          - Type: AWS::S3::Object
            Values: 
              - !Sub "${TargetBucket.Arn}/"
          IncludeManagementEvents: false
          ReadWriteType: WriteOnly
    DependsOn:
      - LogBucketPolicy
```

Here is the extremely tiny step function definition configured using [serverless-step-functions](https://github.com/serverless-operations/serverless-step-functions)

```yml
functions:
	hello:
		handler: src/steps/hello.handler
stepFunctions:
  stateMachines:
    S3TriggeredStateMachine:
      name: i-was-triggered-by-an-s3-put
      events:
        - eventBridge:
            event:
              source:
                - "aws.s3"
              detail-type:
                - "AWS API Call via CloudTrail"
              detail:
                eventSource: 
                  - "s3.amazonaws.com"
                eventName: 
                  - PutObject
                requestParameters:
                  bucketName: 
                    - !Ref TargetBucket
      definition:
        StartAt: Hello
        States:
          Hello:
            Type: Task
            Resource: !GetAtt hello.Arn
            End: true
```

I want to do a more detailed write up explaining how this fits together but if anyone needs help getting this working [message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=985648271476580352) me ðŸ˜Œ I am happy to help
