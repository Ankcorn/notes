Today I setup a personal blog and information management system using [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam). It has been a longstanding ambition to get better at note taking and so far I have not found an approach that sticks. The idea of a digital garden was appealing because it emphasises that you don't start with a complete blog and have to grow your ideas by investing time and effort. 

I hope to write about a range of engineering concepts centered around high throughput data systems but I will likely explore some tangents like web development.
