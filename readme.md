**ðŸ‘‹ This is my Digital Garden. Where I try to create a semblance of structure from seemingly random thoughts.**

I'm a Engineer, partaking in the [Sociotechnical](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/socio-technical-systems) activity that is [agile] software development. In a desperate attempt to provide more structure to the seemingly random collection of ideas, projects, and learnings I have created this site. 

It is mostly a place for me to record things related to my professional life like

* [[programing-languages]]
* [[system-design]]
* [[the-cloud]]

but I also intend to record useful things related to my personal hobbies like

* Recipes
* Plants
* Dogs
* Places to visit

I created this digital garden during a long weekend on this date [[2021-05-03]]
